# Microcontroller_Microprocessor_Lab1
Each exercise will consist of STM32 Project and Proteus Project:
- Ex6 is a testing module for the clock.
- Ex7 is used to clear all clock
- Ex8 & Ex9 aim to set and reset a number on the clock, respectively
- Ex10 will combine all of the above to implement a completely functional clock.
-> All of them are integrated into STM32 project folder since there isn't necessary to keep them separately.
